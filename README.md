## TitanStar Legends - Rune Mastery Loadout Talent Calculator 9000

### Description

This is a challenge in which I built a calculator to manage and simulate how the talent points are used within runes paths.

The functionality's specifics can be sum up as follows:

- Left click to add points.
- Right click to remove points.
  - On Mobile when you tap on an active rune, it will be deactivated
- The user may only use up to 6 points.
- Each item only accounts for one point.
- Displays current point total
- The user must select the items in order.
  - For example: The user may not put a point in the cake without first having put points in the chevrons and the silverware (in that order).
